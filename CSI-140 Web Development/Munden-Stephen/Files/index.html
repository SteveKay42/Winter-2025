                    At E-Pics for Change, we believe 
                    in the power of visual storytelling 
                    and the strength of community. 
                    Our mission is simple: sell e-pictures-
                    stunning digital artwork and photography-
                    and use every dollar of profit to support 
                    charitable efforts to fight homelessness.
                </p>

                    Art has the power to inspire, connect, and transform lives.  By purchasing our digital images, you're not only gaining a beautiful piece of creativity-you're also helping someone in need find food, shelter, and a fresh start.

                    Unlike traditional businesses, every purchase you make directly supports charity. Our proceeds fund shelters, meal programs, and job assistance initiatives for people experiencing homelessness.
